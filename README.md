# PyBer Analysis
## Overview of Project
As the new data analyst of PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. I was assigned the task of creating a DataFrame summary of the ride data depending on the type of city. After this, a multiple linear graph was made where the amount of weekly income was comparatively shown during the first four moths of 2019 depending on the type of city
## Results
In the summary of the cities, it was found that in urban cities there was a greater number of trips, drivers and earnings, however there was a greater number of registered drivers than trips made. On the other hand, in rural cities the average rate per driver was higher. Suburban cities had intermediate values, as seen in Figure 1

When analyzing the weekly profits in the linear graph, we observe that in all the cities there is a profit peak at the end of February, in the same way the urban cities are the ones with the most profits.

## Summary
The CEO of PyBer is advised to reduce the number of drivers in urban cities as there are more drivers than trips made.
In the second place, it is recommended to do some research about the origin of the peak of profits that there is at the end of February.
Finally, drivers could be moved from urban cities to suburban and rural ones.
